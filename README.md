## InterviewTest

This is a simple java project with several issues to help to interview tech candidates.
The business logic is fine. This project has only technical issues.

You'll have 1 hour to compile and refactory all that you can.

## How to use

> Prerequisites: JVM 11, Maven

1. Clone this repo
2. Run the tests using terminal `mvn test` or your IDE
3. Fix the issues
4. Refactory the code (use your best efforts in this phase and speek while you are refactoring, to allow the interviewer knows what do you thinking)
5. Run the tests again
6. Have fun
